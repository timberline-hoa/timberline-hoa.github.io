The election for the new board of directors is finished as of Friday Nov. 3rd. We had 39 out of 102 households vote in this election, exceeding the quorum of 34. The final vote count is as follows:

- Dominick Lewis: 27
- Orin Cummings: 30
- Robert Gully: 29
- Annetta Hill: 22

That makes our new board of directors Lewis, Cummings, and Gully. Thank you to all who voted and participated in the election.

The next steps are to arrange a meeting of the current and new board of directors and assign duties to the new directors. The minutes of this meeting will be posted once this is complete.

# Officers
We also will ask anyone who is interested in being an officer to attend this meeting as well! The new board of directors will vote for people to fill the 4 officer positions at this meeting, which are president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer. If you are interested in being an officer, please reply to this email! The time commitment is very minimal, and the more people we have the fewer responsibilities each person will have to take.
