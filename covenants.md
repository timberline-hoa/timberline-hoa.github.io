  (a) **Enforcement by Suit**. The Board may cause a suit at law to be commenced and maintained in the name of the Association against any Owner to enforce each such assessment obligation. Any judgment rendered in any such action shall include the amount of the delinquency, together with interest thereon at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum from the date of delinquency, court costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees in such amount as the court may adjudge against the delinquent Owner.

  (b) **Enforcement by Lien**.

At any time within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of any default in the payment of any such assessment, the Association or any authorized representative, may, but shall not be required to make a written demand for payment to the defaulting owner, on behalf of the Association. Said demand shall state the date and the amount of the delinquency. Each default shall constitute a separate basis for a demand or claim of lien or a lien, but any number of defaults may be included within a single demand or claim or lien. If such delinquency is not paid within ten (10) days after delivery of such demand, or even without such written demand being made, the Association may elect to file such a claim or lien on behalf of the Association against the Lot of the defaulting Owner. Such a claim of lien shall be executed and acknowledged by any officer öf the Association, and shall contain substantially the following information:

  (1) The name of the delinquent Owner (as shown on the Association records);
  
  (2) The legal description or street address of the lot against which claim of lien is made;

  (4) That the claim of lien is made by the Association pursuant to the Declaration; and

  (5) That a lien is claimed against said Lot in an amount equal to the amount stated.

  Upon (1) recordation of a duly executed original or copy of such a claim or lien, and (2) mailing a copy thereof to said Owner, the lien claimed thereon shall immediately attach and become effective in favor of the Association as a lien upon the Lot against which such Assessment was levied. Such a lien shall have priority over all liens or claims created subsequent to the recordation of the claim of lien thereof, except only tax liens for real property taxes on any Lot, assessments on any Lot in favor of any municipal or other governmental assessing unit, and the liens which are hereinafter specifically described in Section 6. Any such lien may be foreclosed by appropriate action in court or in the manner provided by law for the foreclosure of a deed of trust, with a power of sale, as set forth by the laws of the State of Missouri, as the same may be changed or amended. The lien provided for herein shall be in favor of the Association and shall be for the benefit of the Members. The Association may acquire, hold, lease, mortgage, and convey any such Lot.

Each Owner, by becoming an Owner in TIMBERLINE ESTATES SUBDIVISION, hereby expressly waives any objection to the enforcement and foreclosure of this lien in this manner.

### Section 6: Subordination of the Lien to Mortgages. 
The lien of the assessment provided for herein shall be subordinate to the lien of any first mortgage. Sale or transfer of any Lot shall not affect the assessment lien. However, the sale or transfer of any Lot pursuant to mortgage foreclosure shall extinguish the lien of such assessment as to payments which become due prior to such sale or transfer. No sale or transfer shall relieve such Lot from liability for any assessments thereafter becoming due or from the lien thereof.
