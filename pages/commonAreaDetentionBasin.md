This page will contain information about our common area detention basin, such as the sinkhole and fence.

# Fence for the sinkhole
We are currently deciding how to address this problem. We have a committee assigned to this task and they are working on a tight deadline. More information to come soon.

# Sinkhole History
In May of 2020, a sinkhole formed in our detention basin. At that time it was 3 ft in diameter and 25 ft deep.
The hole was filled with 2"-6" rock, but since then has started to open back up.
