**TIMBERLINE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION FENCE INFORMATION**

It has been a very productive week for the Fence Committee. We have tracked down the insurance policy and spoke to our local agent. We have met with the geologist from Greene County who also did the initial inspection on the sinkhole. In addition, we have the following quotes to build the fence.

After speaking to the insurance agent, he said the underwriters are only requiring us to put a fence around the sinkhole, not the entire retention pond. The underwriters do not require us to fill the sinkhole. However, when we met with the geologist, he did suggest we finish filling the sinkhole. As a committee, we recommend that volunteers from the subdivision finish filling the sinkhole this fall. It is approximately 6-7’ in diameter with about 2’ needed to fill the hole. 

The Fence Committee is using August 10th as the deadline for the fence. (We actually have until the 14th but we are using 4 days as a cushion in case of rain.) 

The following companies have provided us quotes for a 6’ wood privacy fence installed in a square shape placed 4-5 feet out from the sinkhole. There will be a 3’ gate and we have requested a 2” (approximate) “peek hole” on each side so we will be able to inspect the sinkhole without having to open the gate. There will be a heavy-duty padlock placed on the gate to further help with security. 

The following companies, if notified by **TOMORROW, WEDNESDAY**, they can have the fence installed by the 10th. Please keep in mind that we are dealing with an extremely short time frame so **PLEASE PLACE YOUR VOTE BY TOMORROW AT NOON!!!** These companies are licensed, insured and provide a one-year warranty.

# Sinkhole History
In May of 2020, a sinkhole formed in our detention basin. At that time it was 3 ft in diameter and 25 ft deep.
The hole was filled with 2"-6" rock, but since then has started to open back up.
